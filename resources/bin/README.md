# This directory holds bundled binary resources for the packaged installer.
# These files are NOT committed to git — they are generated by:
#
#   npm run prepare-resources
#
# which runs scripts/prepare-resources.ps1

## Layout after running prepare-resources:
#
# resources/bin/
#   magick/
#     magick.exe          <- ImageMagick 7 portable binary
#     *.dll               <- ImageMagick DLLs (many files)
#     modules/            <- ImageMagick codec modules
#     ...
#   rembg/
#     rembg.exe           <- rembg compiled by PyInstaller
#
## These folders are referenced by electron-builder extraResources in package.json.
## At runtime they land at: {app}/resources/bin/{magick|rembg}/
